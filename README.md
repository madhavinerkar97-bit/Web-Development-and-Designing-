Developed multiple web projects during the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Created a responsive Landing Page, a personal Portfolio Website to showcase skills and projects, and a Temperature Converter for converting Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. These projects helped enhance my front-end development skills, UI design, and responsive web designing concepts.
